UMAP with the cell classification by SIMS :

x _umap_sims.pdf : Global UMAP graph with cell type assignation with the first prediction from SIMS

x _umap_sims_threshold.pdf : Global UMAP graph with cell type assignation without the "Unknown cell". We use a threshold of the difference between the first and second score of the prediction to say if a cell is unknown or not.

x _umap_per_labels.pdf : UMAP graph for each cell type assignation (including unknown cells)
